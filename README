# rSPACs

A simple script to get the tickers mentioned in today's top 100 posts of r/SPACs and output a table containing each ticker, number of posts it is mentioned in, total upvotes on the post, and the price.

The output file is a markdown file that is formatted as a Jekyll post for ease of generating a static site to view the data.

## Shortcomings
This script is currently unable to differentiate SPACs from non SPAC tickers mentioned (or for that matter uppercase words that just happen to be a ticker). This may be fixed in the future.
